## About it
*This website simply shows what I'm listening to on Spotify through Lanyard API*
*When the website says "offline :(" I'm probably don't have Discord or Spotify turned on. Or I'm on my phone.*

## Functionality
*I'm using [ColorThief](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/color-thief/2.3.0/color-thief.umd.js) library which takes two dominant colors from the song's cover art and applies it as a gradient*
*Clicking on the picture will redict you on Spotify to the song I'm currently playing*
> more features coming soon!
